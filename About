This project involves analyzing customer reviews from various languages using a self-curated multilingual dataset. The dataset includes two columns:

 1) Review_Text: Customer reviews in diverse languages (e.g., English, Hindi, Telugu)
 2) Rating: Corresponding numerical ratings (e.g., 1.0 to 5.0)
The primary aim was to investigate how accurately a machine learning model can predict user ratings from multilingual review text.

Key Steps:

[1] Text Preprocessing: Processed multilingual text with TfidfVectorizer, which has basic multilingual tokenization.

[2] Model Training: Trained a Linear Regression model to predict Rating values from review text.

[3] Evaluation: The accuracy of the model was evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R²) metrics.

[4] Visualization: Graphs were utilized to compare actual vs predicted ratings and model performance on train/test sets.

The model was good, getting an R² value of about 0.79 on the training data and 0.64 on the test data with a minimal Mean Squared Error in either scenario.
